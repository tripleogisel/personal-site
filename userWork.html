				<p class="projectTitle">May. 2016 – Mobile Ticket Sales Landing View</p>
				<p class="description">We built technology for NBA, NHL, NFL, MLB, NCAA and Concert partners to sell tickets via mobile. The flexible technology allowed teams to customize offers, so we tested a theory that a landing page view before the select-your-tickets view would improve the user experience. The landing page view tested well and this technology has sold over $4 million in tickets since its launch.</p>

	<h2 class="projectName">"HANDSHAKE TESTS"<br><br>UX SYSTEM DESIGN, PROTOTYPING, USABILITY TESTING<br><br>Sells millions of dollars with of pro sports tickets every year</h2>

	<p class="projectDescription">We user tested 2 visual concepts of our best hypothesis for an ideal user experience buying tickets and upgrades at an NBA game. This test (from April 2016) represents part of a much longer UX redesign process that we began in January 2016 at Experience (<a href="http://expapp.com">expapp.com</a>). We invited real customers into our office to test prototypes (built in Axure) against the live-in-production design. This product sells tens of thousands of tickets via mobile on behalf of 100+ NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and NCAA teams. We moderated tests with over 10 real Atlanta Hawks customers. Our tests relied on a ~new software called Lookback.io to run fully immersive usability tests that recorded both vocal and facial responses as well as every tap on the screen at the same time.</p>

Every decision we made was based on 2 key variable circumstances: 1) fan anonymity and 2) ticket inventory <br><br> Design works on this document in coordination with a product manager, and outlined 9 possible screen states before engineering began work.</p>
