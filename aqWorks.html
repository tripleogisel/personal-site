				<h2 class="pageIntro">Story:<br><br> Post Acquisition UX/Ui Redesign at Experience</h2>
				<p class="description">Contribution: Co-led and executed the complete redesign of a mobile web app providing ticketing, commerce and authentication solutions to over 300 professional sport, collegiate sport, concert, and live entertainment properties. <br><br>

My work on the 2016 UX/Ui Redesign at Experience makes me proud because it taught me three valuable lessons. First, it gave me a reliable structure to design human-centered products that affect culture in a positive way. Second, it led me to understand the value of being surrounded by design-infused thinkers. Third, it proved to me that and effective solution depends on a visceral understanding of the problem. <br><br>

Acquired by Cox Enterprises in Fall 2014, Experience hired a Director of Product design on Jan. 1, 2016 to lead full UX/Ui redesign of its 4 year old mobile web application. He joined me to create Experience's first-ever design team. As a team of 2, we worked in tandem on to improve the entire user experience and delivered solutions that scaled with our partners' offerings. <br><br>

Together we:<br><br>
#1 Collected user journey data and survey responses to identify key pain points and drop-off locations<br><br>
#2 Completed an audit of every flow and view in the application to better understand existing UX and technical dependencies<br><br>
#3 Conducted a baseline heuristic evaluation of the existing product to highlight potential causes behind UX gaps<br><br>
#4 Led cross-functional two-hour design sprint sessions with over forty employees to gather ideas and broaden our understanding <br><br>
#5 Mapped out a new IA and content wire frames<br><br>
#6 Hosted 10 real customers to participate in user tests with two prototypes <br><br>
#7 Created a Ui design system built on reusable components<br><br>
#8 Developed a new visual design brand feel. <br><br>
In the end, we shipped an intuitive product that focused on  familiarity and progressive engagement. Our solutions made it easy for customers to sign up for notifications future events, gave them a central location to customize and manage events, and displayed product offerings in a more natural way.
<br><br>
During this project I learned how to lead a truly user-centered UX/Ui redesign, and why it applies well to a wide range of problems. Also, I learned about how a team of designers is infinitely more powerful than an individual designer – multiple designers working together who collaborate, debate and critique in a constructive way deliver the best solutions. Finally, I learned about the importance of understanding the problems. Looking at the our redesign process on this project – steps 1-4 above are all about understanding the problem. Only in steps 5-8 did we begin to explore solutions, find more problems, and iterate toward the better results.
<br><br>
This project made me a much better designer and problem-solver in general. I'm eager to find more projects that will empower me to grow and develop like this one.</p>

				<h2 class="pageIntro">"Film is dead!" "Radio is dead" ... eh!</h2>
				<p class="description">It's surprising how technologies or approaches that were once considered outdated can gain a new significance, especially when they intersect with web-based technologies. The reemergence film photography and the rise of internet radio provide two effective examples to examine how the intersection of old technologies with web-based technologies can influence behavior and nudge industries. <br><br>

Film photography puts more pressure on each photo, it takes time to see the shot afterwards, yields [sometimes unwanted, often pleasant] visual effects in terms of both clarity and distortion that photographers cannot achieve with a mobile device camera, and requires purchase of additional hardware to even do. <br><br>

Prominent contemporary film photographers such as Irman Ciesay, Hannah Sider, Dexter Navy, and many more upload their photos to Instagram as a key marketing strategy. But, it also inspires lots of other people to take film photos. Someone looking at Instagram may see an account post a film photo, like the way it looks, go buy a film camera, and start taking photos with it rather than being on their phone. In this sense, the manifestation of an old technology (film photography) in a new technology (Instagram) has a tremendous influence on culture.<br><br>

Internet radio stations offers an appealing alternative to the more popular streaming services. TheLotRadio, HotelRadioParis, Know Wave, Lumpen Radio, Nts.live, and more provide anyone with internet access the option to sit back and listen to curated live music for free, mostly without a single ad (all but Lumpen). While it requires minimal effort to tune in, these live DJ sets on radio stations help listeners discover great new music more in a more natural way. This discovery experience contrasts the streaming services that promote songs, artists, albums and playlists in context of mutual business interests. Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Google Music, Tidal, (or some combination) bombard users with options that can require more digging, user interaction, etc. to discover something. Live DJ sets on internet radio stations will become even more popular as discovery outlets for new music as more music becomes available from the increasing number of artists online.<br><br>

It's easy to imagine a scenario where services use a machine algorithm to recommend that you follow an individual who's played 25 internet radio sets (50hrs of music), rather than recommend a specific song or artist. This is only one example of how internet radio may affect the in-flux music industry.<br><br>

There's so much information and content for anyone with a "smart" mobile device to consume. But as our options increase, technologies, approaches, and mediums once depicted as outdated are rising to a new degree of prominence again. They now have the ability to influence the contemporary technologies.<br><br>

				<h2 class="pageIntro">Why I'm interested in AQ</h2>
				<p class="description">The office location and your case study about Repro compelled me to apply to AQ. I studied Japanese history in college and have developed an even deeper interest in the country as my career in design has expanded over the last 4 years. I have never visited before but am scheduled to be in Tokyo from Jan. 23 - Feb 6, 2017. The approach you took on the Repro project inspired me – changing the marketing site first was a smart decision. It led me to reflect on the redesign at Experience, and made me wish we had worked more closely with our sales team at the initial outset of that project. They are our marketing site for this b2b2c technology, and could have helped prepare our partners for upcoming changes more effectively. The job description also excites me. Two parts stand out the most – your refreshing willingness to welcome new methodologies that help define AQ, and your desire for someone who's eager both to lead a team and do design work at the same time. Finally, your "Ways we work" section aligns well with my beliefs about effective design process. I know I'd be a great fit on the AQ design team.
