		<h2 class="projectName">Mobile App to sell NBA tickets and upgrades <br><br> Prototyping and real usability testing</h2>
		
		<p class="projectDescription">We designed 2 prototypes based off of a complete information architecutre and UX redsign for our mobile web app at Experience. We invited real customers into our office to test prototypes (built in Axure) with our proposed UX design system against the live-in-production design. It's a product that sells tens of thousands of NBA, MLB, NHL and NCAA tickets and upgrades to sports fans every year. We moderated tests with over 10 people. We relied on a ~new software called Lookback.io to runfully immersive usability tests that recorded both vocal and facial responses as well as every tap on the screen at the same time.
